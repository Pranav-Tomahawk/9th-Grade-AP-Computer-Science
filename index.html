	<h2>Your guide to high school</h2>

	<div class="intro" , id="hello there">
		<p>
			Hello there, people from the AP Exam. We are Pranav and Yogansh, the ones who designed this webpage. If you are seeing this
			it is probably past the deadline for the AP Computer Science Create Task. For this project we created a student "cheat
			sheet", with notes from all we learnt throughout 9th grade at our high school. These notes come from the core classes,
			Science, Math, English, and History. There are also possibly other notes from our Language classes ( Spanish and French
			) and Band.

			<em>This webpage contains everything you need.</em>
            If you were a student in the modern age, I am sure that you must've searched online for a formula or calculator or asked help with a question, but the websites aren't trustworthy so you could end up with a wrong answer. Well, We have managed to create a site where each core class can be found with its tips on each allocated page for its given subject.
